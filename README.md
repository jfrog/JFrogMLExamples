## Overview

This repository contains example projects that showcase the capabilities of the JFrog ML for MLOps. Each project is designed to be a standalone example, demonstrating different aspects of machine learning, from data preprocessing to model building and deployment.

## Documentation

All documentation for the JFrog ML Platform can be found on the [JFrog ML Documentation](https://docs.qwak.com/docs/introduction) website.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the example project you're interested in.
3. Follow the README and installation instructions within each project folder.

## Pre-requisites

To use the JFrog ML Platform for MLOps, you will need:
